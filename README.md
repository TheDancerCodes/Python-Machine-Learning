# python-machine-learning

A simple example introducing Understanding Machine Learning [Python].

We will use Python libraries for ML:
* Numpy - scientific computing.
* Pandas - data frames.
* Matplotlib - 2D plot.
* Scikit-learn - provides simple and effective tools for performing many ML operations.
